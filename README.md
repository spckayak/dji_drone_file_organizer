# dji_drone_file_organizer
Organizes the file structure (both images and videos) for the DJI Mavic Air 2

This code will attempt to organize DJI Mavic Air 2 Videos and Images into a structured file format

In order for this to work an image taken around the area AND time you were flying is required for the GPS location. This is used as a refrence point as video does not contain GPS info.
